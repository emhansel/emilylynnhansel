          Emily Hansel began her dance training in Rochester, Minnesota at 
          Allegro School of Dance and Minnesota Youth Ballet Academy. She 
          performed with Minneapolis’s Metropolitan Ballet, danced in several 
          projects at the Ritz Theater in Minneapolis, and founded the Summer 
          Choreography Workshop in Rochester. She attended the summer 
          intensives of Alonzo King LINES Ballet, the San Francisco Conservatory 
          of Dance, and American Ballet Theatre. In 2012, at age 17, Emily 
          received the Homer Avila Award from Alonzo King LINES Ballet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emily received her BFA in Dance Performance from the University of South Florida, 
          where she established herself as a dynamic performer, choreographer, 
          scholar, and leader. She performed in works by Ohad Naharin, Alonzo 
          King, Robert Moses, Maurice Causey, Bliss Kohlmyer, Paula Nunez, 
          Andrew Carroll, and Jeanne Travers and, in October 2015, she 
          performed at the International Creative Dance Seminar at the 
          Beijing Dance Academy in Beijing, China. Also in 2015, Emily 
          attended USF’s Dance in Paris Program where she studied under 
          dancers from companies such as Tanztheater Wuppertal, Chunky Move, 
          and Nederlands Dans Theater. In 2014, Emily attended the American 
          Dance Festival School where she worked with choreographer Carl Flink 
          and performed in his ADF-commissioned piece, <i>Unkindness of Ravens</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emily’s choreography has been presented several times in USF’s annual 
          Student Dance Production among other shows at the University and 
          throughout Florida. Her work, No Reason, was selected to be 
          presented at the Southeast ACDA Conference in March 2016. Emily 
          is currently seeking out new venues where she can share her most 
          recent project, <i>untitled_37.txt</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to performance and choreography, Emily continually 
          finds herself drawn to jobs that revolve around administration 
          and operations. She served as the President of USF’s Student Dance 
          Production Board, which involved overseeing every aspect of production 
          for the annual student-run and student-choreographed concert among 
          other managerial and organizational responsibilities. She worked 
          on the TEDxUSF Affairs Team for two years and held various other 
          leadership positions in the USF community. Emily graduated summa 
          cum laude in May 2016 as a King O'Neal Scholar and a Provost's Scholar 
          with a BFA in Dance Performance and an Honors College Degree.
