        Emily Hansel began her dance training in Rochester, Minnesota at 
        Allegro School of Dance and Minnesota Youth Ballet Academy. She 
        performed with Minneapolis’s Metropolitan Ballet, danced in several 
        projects at the Ritz Theater in Minneapolis, and founded the Summer 
        Choreography Workshop in Rochester. She attended the summer 
        intensives of Alonzo King LINES Ballet, the San Francisco Conservatory 
        of Dance, and American Ballet Theatre. In 2012, at age 17, Emily 
        received the Homer Avila Award from Alonzo King LINES Ballet.

        Emily received her BFA in Dance Performance from the University of South Florida, 
        where she established herself as a dynamic performer, choreographer, 
        scholar, and leader. She performed in works by Ohad Naharin, Alonzo 
        King, Robert Moses, Maurice Causey, Bliss Kohlmyer, Paula Nunez, 
        Andrew Carroll, and Jeanne Travers and, in October 2015, she 
        performed at the International Creative Dance Seminar at the 
        Beijing Dance Academy in Beijing, China. Also in 2015, Emily 
        attended USF’s Dance in Paris Program where she studied under 
        dancers from companies such as Tanztheater Wuppertal, Chunky Move, 
        and Nederlands Dans Theater. In 2014, Emily attended the American 
        Dance Festival School where she worked with choreographer Carl Flink 
        and performed in his ADF-commissioned piece, <i>Unkindness of Ravens</i>.

        Emily’s choreography has been presented several times in USF’s annual 
        Student Dance Production among other shows at the University and 
        throughout Florida. Her work, No Reason, was selected to be 
        presented at the Southeast ACDA Conference in March 2016. Emily 
        is currently seeking out new venues where she can share her most 
        recent project, <i>untitled_37.txt</i>.
      p.
        In addition to performance and choreography, Emily continually 
        finds herself drawn to jobs that revolve around administration 
        and operations. She served as the President of USF’s Student Dance 
        Production Board, which involved overseeing every aspect of production 
        for the annual student-run and student-choreographed concert among 
        other managerial and organizational responsibilities. She worked 
        on the TEDxUSF Affairs Team for two years and held various other 
        leadership positions in the USF community. Emily graduated summa 
        cum laude in May 2016 as a King O'Neal Scholar and a Provost's Scholar 
        with a BFA in Dance Performance and an Honors College Degree.
