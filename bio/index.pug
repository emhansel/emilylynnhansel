        Emily’s choreography has been presented multiple times in USF’s annual Student Dance Production among other 
        shows. Emily is currently conducting research for her Honors Thesis, “The Representation of Ideas by Words 
        and Art,” which will culminate in the choreography and performance of a solo in April 2015.

        held various other leadership positions in the USF community. Emily is on her way to becoming a
