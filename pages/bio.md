In 2012, Emily received the Homer Avila Award from Alonzo King LINES Ballet.

Emily received her BFA in Dance from the [University of South Florida](http://theatreanddance.arts.usf.edu/content/go/dance/), where she performed in works by Ohad Naharin, Alonzo King, Robert Moses, Maurice Causey, Bliss Kohlmyer, Paula Nunez, Andrew Carroll, Jeanne Travers, and Xiao Xiang Rong among others and served as President of the Student Dance Production Board.
