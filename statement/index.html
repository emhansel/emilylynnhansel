and audiences. <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> work to challenge myself and to challenge existing paradigms – 
both within and beyond dance. <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> constantly seek out the new, exploring things that 
<span class="bio-highlight">I</span> have never done before and things that no one has ever done before. 
<span class="bio-highlight">I</span> admire people who can change my mind and <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> enjoy having my mind changed 
because it indicates that <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> have learned something. <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> admire art that dissatisfies 
or irritates its audiences because great art has the capacity to do more than simply please all people.</p><p><span class="bio-highlight">I</span> am interested in witnessing – and participating in – sincerity and honesty onstage. <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> admire dancers 
who can simply be and do during performance rather than those who simulate or put on anything 
artificial. In order to portray an emotion or a sensation, <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> enter a scenario in which <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> truly 
feel the emotion or sensation. Instead of pretending to feel something, <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> am able to actually 
experience it and whatever movement results is therefore entirely genuine.</p><p>As a choreographer, <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> am interested in turning the stage into a world in which dancers can exist. 
<span class="bio-highlight">I</span> value diversity and individuality among a group of performers. <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> am drawn to artists with 
distinctive voices and <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> respect my dancers as individuals with their own wealth of experiences. 
Accordingly, <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> value unison of intent among a group of performers more than <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> value perfect physical unison.</p><p><span class="bio-highlight">I</span> create work in order to share my ideas with other people. <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> do not aim to please or to displease 
my audiences; <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> want merely to expose them to my ideas and be a witness to their reactions. 
<span class="bio-highlight">I</span> strive to interact with audiences through my work. However, <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> often find it difficult to 
communicate ideas about my choreography via spoken or written language. Dance is capable of 
expressing different things than words can, and <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> do not attempt to impose the confines of 
language upon dance. Thus, <span class="bio-highlight">I</span> usually let my work speak for itself.</p></div></div><script src="/assets/js/jquery.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/app.js"></script></body></html>
