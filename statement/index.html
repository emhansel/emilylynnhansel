        <h1>Artist Statement</h1><p>&quot;I respect art that challenges. I appreciate when choreographers challenge their dancers, peers,
and audiences. I work to challenge myself and to challenge existing paradigms –
both within and beyond dance. I constantly seek out the new, exploring things that
I have never done before and things that no one has ever done before.
I admire people who can change my mind and I enjoy having my mind changed
because it indicates that I have learned something. I admire art that dissatisfies
or irritates its audiences because great art has the capacity to do more than simply please all people.</p>
<p>I am interested in witnessing – and participating in – sincerity and honesty onstage. I admire dancers
who can simply <em>be</em> and <em>do</em> during performance rather than those who simulate or put on anything
artificial. In order to portray an emotion or a sensation, I enter a scenario in which I truly
feel the emotion or sensation. Instead of pretending to feel something, I am able to actually
experience it and whatever movement results is therefore entirely genuine.</p>
<p>As a choreographer, I am interested in turning the stage into a world in which dancers can exist.
I value diversity and individuality among a group of performers. I am drawn to artists with
distinctive voices and I respect my dancers as individuals with their own wealth of experiences.
Accordingly, I value unison of intent among a group of performers more than I value perfect physical unison.</p>
<p>I create work in order to share my ideas with other people. I do not aim to please or to displease
my audiences; I want merely to expose them to my ideas and be a witness to their reactions.
I strive to interact with audiences through my work. However, I often find it difficult to
communicate ideas about my choreography via spoken or written language. Dance is capable of
expressing different things than words can, and I do not attempt to impose the confines of
language upon dance. Thus, I usually let my work speak for itself.&quot;</p>
