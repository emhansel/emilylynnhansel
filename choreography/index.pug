            <i>untitled_37.txt</i> was the culmination of over a year’s worth of
            research on the subjectivity of language. Words are not equivalent
            to ideas, they simply represent ideas. Words attempt to
            accurately portray the abstract in a concrete manner. The research
            developed into an exploration of the human need to make the abstract tangible.

            <i>untitled_37.txt</i> premiered on April 27, 2016 at the
            University of South Florida. This piece was the fruit of Emily’s

            for the Honors College at USF.

            <i>No Reason</i> premiered at the University of South Florida’s
            Theatre One in December 2015.  It was later selected to be presented at
            the 2016 Southeast ACDA Conference, where it received rave
            reviews from the adjudicators for its originality as a
            “sophisticated fusion of dance theater, improvisation, and contemporary movement.”

          p.
            <i>Vertical Words</i> is an attempt to prove that the perception of meaning is
            inevitable, regardless of whether or not the artist intended any meaning. The
            choreographic process was inspired by the "word sculptures" of minimalist sculptor, Carl Andre.

          p.
            This film is a response to a performance of Angelin Preljocaj's "Empty Moves"
            (performed by Ballet Preljocaj). The show's program notes included this statement:
          p.
            “To highlight his process [Preljocaj] turns to John Cage’s "Empty Words," a
            random string of phonemes, read by Cage during his performance in Milan – a
            demonstrative act to show that the abstract exists and that it is unbearable
            to the audience who responds by jeering at the unperturbed performer….[Preljocaj's
            four dancers onstage] are paid homage by an audience, who although not
            necessarily willing to listen, has at least agreed to look upon abstraction.”
          p.
            John Cage and his partner Merce Cunningham were two artists who refused to seduce
            audiences through romanticism, narrative, or encoded meanings. They often referred
            to their work as "meaningless" or "purposeless." But this attempt to signify nothing
            signifies something. The attempt to remove purpose is a purpose itself.

            Music by ltlp, additional audio from Patrick McCarty.
          p.
            <i>Insatiable</i> was created in 2015 at the University of South Florida.
            It is the product of an exploration of the benefits and downfalls
            of selfishness and unceasing ambition – such persistence can lead
            to great accomplishments as well as disasters. This includes
            an investigation of Plato and Aristotle’s ideas on human
            appetite (or passion) versus reason (which governs the passions).
            The piece was invited to be performed in a full-scale concert
            in USF's dance department as well as other performances at USF.
